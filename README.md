* User stories are an agile software development/ project management tool that provides users with simple, natural language explanations of one or more features written from the end-user's perspective.
* User stories also form the building block of agile frameworks like epics and initiatives.
* Epics represent a large amount of work broken down into user stories.
* A combination of multiple epics forms an initiative.

  * S - Small: shouldn't be too big and should be completed in about 40 hours or 3 or 4 days.
  * T - Testable: should have acceptance criteria that can be tested to check if they fulfill the customer's needs.
